      Lean thinking started in 1913 with Henry Ford. At his Highland Park, Michigan plant, Ford created what he called "flow production." He lined up all the fabrication steps in order and got parts flowing through fast. His system was revolutionary, but it had a problem. It wasn't varied. Every Model T was basically the same. Around 1918, Sakichi Toyoda started his business in Japan with a patent for an automatic loom. By 1950, his successors Eiji Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno went to America to study manufacturing. They looked at Ford's system and saw the flaws. Companies were making huge batches of parts that just sat in inventory, and they cared more about production volume than what customers actually wanted. So Toyota took Ford's flow ideas and figured out how to add flexibility. That became the Toyota Production System. The word "lean" didn't come along until 1990 when it was coined in the book "The Machine That Changed the World."

      One really cool application of Lean showed up in software development through <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/agilemethodbootcamp/kanban-method" target="_blank" style="color: #1a8a8a; font-weight: 600; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #2dd4bf; transition: border-color 0.3s ease;" onmouseover="this.style.borderColor='#1a8a8a'" onmouseout="this.style.borderColor='#2dd4bf'">Kanban</a>. It started as a scheduling system with visual cards on the factory floor at Toyota. In 2004, David J. Anderson figured out how to adapt it for software teams. Kanban helps teams see their workflow, limit how much work they're doing at once, and keep improving. It basically brought Lean principles straight into modern software development.
