      {
        topic: "Agile Fundamentals",
        topicId: "agile-fundamentals",
        question: "Which of the following is a characteristic of Agile methodology?",
        answer: "C) Iterative and incremental approach",
        explanation: "Agile methodology is characterized by an iterative and incremental approach, delivering work in small chunks rather than all at once. This allows for continuous feedback and adaptation.",
        memoryTip: "Think 'ITERATE' - Agile teams repeat cycles of planning, building, and reviewing, constantly improving with each iteration."
      },
      {
        topic: "Agile Fundamentals",
        topicId: "agile-fundamentals",
        question: "In which scenario is the Waterfall methodology most effective?",
        answer: "C) Projects with well-defined requirements and scope",
        explanation: "Waterfall is most effective when requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change, as it follows a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.",
        memoryTip: "Waterfall = Water flowing DOWN in one direction. Once it goes down, it can't go back up! Best for fixed requirements."
      },
      {
        topic: "Agile Fundamentals",
        topicId: "agile-fundamentals",
        question: "What is a key principle stated in the Agile Manifesto?",
        answer: "C) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools",
        explanation: "The Agile Manifesto values 'Individuals and interactions over processes and tools,' emphasizing that people and their communication are more important than rigid processes.",
        memoryTip: "Remember 'People > Process' - Agile puts PEOPLE first. The 4 values all follow the pattern: [Agile thing] OVER [Traditional thing]."
      },
      {
        topic: "Agile Fundamentals",
        topicId: "agile-fundamentals",
        question: "Which Agile value emphasizes delivering functional products over extensive documentation?",
        answer: "B) Working software over comprehensive documentation",
        explanation: "The Agile Manifesto states 'Working software over comprehensive documentation,' meaning that while documentation has value, a functioning product is more important.",
        memoryTip: "SHOW, don't tell! Would you rather read a 100-page manual or actually USE the working software?"
      },

      // Scrum Framework
      {
        topic: "Scrum Framework",
        topicId: "scrum-framework",
        question: "What is the primary purpose of a Sprint in Scrum?",
        answer: "B) To deliver a potentially shippable product increment",
        explanation: "The primary purpose of a Sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. Sprints are time-boxed iterations (typically 2-4 weeks) that result in a working product.",
        memoryTip: "Sprint = Short RACE to the finish line with a working product. Athletes don't stop mid-sprint - neither do Scrum teams!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Framework",
        topicId: "scrum-framework",
        question: "Which of the following is NOT a Scrum event?",
        answer: "D) Project Kickoff",
        explanation: "Project Kickoff is not a Scrum event. The five Scrum events are: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.",
        memoryTip: "Remember 'S-P-D-R-R' for the 5 events: Sprint, Planning, Daily, Review, Retrospective. No 'Kickoff' in that list!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Framework",
        topicId: "scrum-framework",
        question: "How long is a typical Sprint in Scrum?",
        answer: "B) 2-4 weeks",
        explanation: "A typical Sprint lasts 2-4 weeks. This time-box provides enough time to deliver meaningful work while maintaining the agility to respond to change.",
        memoryTip: "Think of a MONTH split in half. 2 weeks minimum, 4 weeks (1 month) maximum. Not too short, not too long - just right!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Framework",
        topicId: "scrum-framework",
        question: "What does 'time-boxed' mean in Scrum?",
        answer: "B) Events have a maximum duration that cannot be exceeded",
        explanation: "Time-boxed means events have a maximum duration that cannot be exceeded. This ensures efficiency and prevents meetings from running too long.",
        memoryTip: "Time-BOX = Put time in a BOX with a LID on it. Once the lid closes (time's up), you're DONE. No extensions!"
      },

      // Scrum Roles
      {
        topic: "Scrum Roles",
        topicId: "scrum-roles",
        question: "Who is responsible for managing the product backlog in Scrum?",
        answer: "C) Product Owner",
        explanation: "The Product Owner is responsible for managing the product backlog, including prioritizing items, ensuring clarity, and maximizing the value of the product.",
        memoryTip: "Product OWNER = OWNS the product backlog. It's in the name! They decide what goes in the product."
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Roles",
        topicId: "scrum-roles",
        question: "Which role in Scrum is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process?",
        answer: "B) Scrum Master",
        explanation: "The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, coaching the team, removing impediments, and ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted.",
        memoryTip: "Scrum MASTER = MASTER of the Scrum process (not the boss!). Like a martial arts master who teaches and guides."
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Roles",
        topicId: "scrum-roles",
        question: "What is the primary responsibility of the Development Team?",
        answer: "C) Deliver a potentially releasable increment each Sprint",
        explanation: "The Development Team is responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of working product at the end of each Sprint.",
        memoryTip: "Development Team = DEVELOPERS who BUILD stuff. Their job is simple: DELIVER working software every Sprint!"
      },

        explanation: "The Product Owner represents the voice of the customer and stakeholders, ensuring the team builds the right product with maximum value.",
        memoryTip: "Product Owner = Customer's VOICE in the room. Imagine them wearing a customer costume to every meeting!"
      },

      {
        topic: "Scrum Events",
        topicId: "scrum-events",
        question: "What is the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective?",
        answer: "C) To reflect on the past Sprint and plan improvements",
        explanation: "The Sprint Retrospective is held at the end of each Sprint for the team to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and plan improvements for the next Sprint.",
        memoryTip: "RETRO-spective = Looking BACKWARD in time (retro). Like watching a REPLAY of the Sprint to learn from it."
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Events",
        topicId: "scrum-events",
        question: "How long is a typical Daily Scrum meeting?",
        answer: "B) 15 minutes",
        explanation: "The Daily Scrum is time-boxed to 15 minutes. This short duration forces the team to stay focused on the three key questions and coordinate their work efficiently.",
        memoryTip: "15 minutes = Quarter of an hour = Quick coffee break. Stand up, sync up, sit down. That's it!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Events",
        topicId: "scrum-events",
        question: "What happens during Sprint Planning?",
        answer: "B) The team selects items from the product backlog and plans how to deliver them",
        explanation: "During Sprint Planning, the team selects product backlog items for the upcoming Sprint and creates a plan (Sprint Backlog) for how to deliver the selected work.",
        memoryTip: "Sprint PLANNING = Making a PLAN for the Sprint. Before the race (Sprint), athletes plan their strategy!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Events",
        topicId: "scrum-events",
        question: "Who attends the Sprint Review?",
        answer: "B) The Scrum Team and stakeholders",
        explanation: "The Sprint Review is attended by the Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team) and key stakeholders to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog.",
        memoryTip: "Sprint REVIEW = SHOW and tell! Invite everyone interested (stakeholders) to see what you built. It's demo day!"
      },

      // Scrum Artifacts
      {
        topic: "Scrum Artifacts",
        topicId: "scrum-artifacts",
        question: "What does the Sprint Backlog contain?",
        answer: "B) Selected product backlog items for the Sprint and a plan for delivering them",
        explanation: "The Sprint Backlog contains the product backlog items selected for the Sprint plus the plan for delivering them. It's the Development Team's plan for the Sprint.",
        memoryTip: "Sprint Backlog = Team's TO-DO list for THIS Sprint only. Take items from Product Backlog + add HOW to do it."
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Artifacts",
        topicId: "scrum-artifacts",
        question: "Which artifact represents the sum of all completed product backlog items during a Sprint?",
        answer: "C) Increment",
        explanation: "The Increment is the sum of all product backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. It must be in a usable condition and meet the Definition of Done.",
        memoryTip: "INCREMENT = Adding UP all the completed work. Like building with LEGO - each Sprint adds more bricks to the total!"
      },
      {
        topic: "Scrum Artifacts",
        topicId: "scrum-artifacts",
